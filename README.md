# Cybersecurity-Network-Analysis-Project
Analyzed network traffic data from the IDS 2017 dataset to identify the most frequent attack types, top attacked ports, high-risk source IPs, and hourly attack trends. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with dynamic slicers to visualize patterns over time and provide actionable cybersecurity insights.
