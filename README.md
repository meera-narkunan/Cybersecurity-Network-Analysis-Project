# Cybersecurity-Network-Analysis-Project

## Summary
Analyzed network traffic data from the IDS 2017 dataset to compare benign vs. attack traffic, identify the most frequent attack types, top attacked ports, high-risk source IPs, and hourly attack trends. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with dynamic slicers to visualize patterns over time and provide actionable cybersecurity insights.

- **Tools:** SQL, Power BI
- **Dataset:** IDS 2017 (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity) ‚Äî https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

## üõ†Ô∏è How It‚Äôs Built
- **SQL (data prep & aggregation)**  
  Queries used to summarize and shape the data are in **/SQL**:

- **Power BI (visualization)**  
  - Date & label slicers for interactive filtering
  - Donut chart for attack distribution  
  - Bar/column charts for ports & source IPs  
  - Line chart for hourly trends  
  - Clustered bar for benign vs attack characteristics

## üîé Key Insights 

**Most Frequent Attacks:** The top attack types observed were **DoS Hulk**, **Portscan**, and **DDoS**, highlighting common methods used in network intrusion attempts.

**Targeted Destination Ports:** Port **80** was the most frequently targeted, indicating attackers primarily aimed at web services.

**Traffic Characteristics:**

- **Benign traffic** has a higher average bytes per second, showing regular network activity is more consistent in volume.  
- **Attack traffic** exhibits significantly longer durations, suggesting prolonged or sustained attack attempts.

**High-Risk Source IPs:** The IP **172.16.0.1** was the most active source of attacks, representing a critical point for monitoring and mitigation.

**Peak Attack Time:** The majority of attacks occurred around **10 AM**, indicating potential patterns in attacker behavior or network vulnerability periods.
